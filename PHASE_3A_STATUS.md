## ⏳ REMAINING TASKS

### 8. Update Dashboard with Statistics
**Status:** Not started
**Location:** `/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

**Requirements:**
- Add statistics cards:
  - "Upcoming Omitted Meetings: X" (count where date >= today)
  - "Upcoming Special Meetings: X" (count where date >= today)
  - "Meeting Pattern: [Midweek]/[Weekend]" (show configured days)
- Use existing card/grid layout from dashboard

### 9. Update Schedule View with Special Meeting Badges
**Status:** Not started
**Location:** `/src/components/ScheduleTable.jsx`

**Requirements:**
- Add visual indicator for special meetings:
  - Different background color for special meeting rows (light blue vs white)
  - Badge/pill showing comment text
  - Tooltip on hover if comment is truncated
- Conditional CSS classes based on `meeting.type === 'special'`
- Display `meeting.comment` in a styled badge

---

## 🧪 TESTING NEEDED

After completing remaining tasks, test these scenarios:

### Omitted Meetings
- [ ] Add omitted Thursday (future date) → Should appear in list
- [ ] Generate schedule → Should skip that Thursday
- [ ] Add omitted date on Monday → Should show validation error
- [ ] Add past date → Should show validation error
- [ ] Reload app with past omitted dates → Should auto-remove and show console log

### Special Meetings
- [ ] Create "Memorial" for future date → Should appear in list
- [ ] Generate schedule including that date → Should appear with comment badge
- [ ] Create special meeting on existing schedule date → Should merge correctly
- [ ] Edit special meeting comment → Should update in list
- [ ] Delete special meeting → Should remove cleanly

### Meeting Days Configuration
- [ ] Change to Tue/Sun before any schedule → Should save
- [ ] Generate schedule → Should lock automatically
- [ ] Try to change meeting days after schedule → Should show warning and prevent
- [ ] Schedule respects new days (Tue/Sun) in generation

### Integration
- [ ] Omit a Thursday → Add special meeting on same date → Should warn about conflict
- [ ] Generate 4-week schedule with 1 omitted date and 1 special meeting → Should correctly skip omitted, include special
- [ ] Export schedule to JSON → Should include settings, omittedDates, specialMeetings
- [ ] Import old JSON (v1.0) → Should migrate to v2.0 with defaults

## 📝 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Migration Strategy:** Automatic migration from v1.0 to v2.0 on load, with defaults for new fields
2. **Lock Mechanism:** Settings lock automatically after first schedule generation (not on every save)
3. **Date Normalization:** All date comparisons normalize to midnight (setHours(0,0,0,0)) to avoid time component issues
4. **Special Meeting Duties:** Special meetings can have pre-existing duties that are preserved/merged during schedule generation
5. **Backward Compatibility:** Kept `cancelledDates` parameter in scheduler for backward compatibility, but omittedDates is the new standard
